As part of the 2018 <a href="https://www.statistiktage.ch/en/">Swiss Statistics Meeting</a>, hackdays will be held for the first time. During the 
hackdays, interested participants will research the potential of various data sets. The attendees will work together in interdisciplinary teams to explore the data and master the challenges. The different skills and backgrounds within 
the different teams will allow for creativity and the development of new solutions and ideas.

#### Free participation & family-friendly setting

**Participation in the hackdays is free**. In freely-chosen teams, participants will work on visualisations and analyses among other things. 
Rooms will be available for this purpose as of Saturday 25 August. Refreshments and a high-performance wifi connection will be available around the clock.
Attendees of the <a href="https://www.statistiktage.ch/en/">Swiss Statistics Meeting</a> are also naturally welcome whether as active team members or bystanders. A supervised playarea for children will be available during the hackdays.
